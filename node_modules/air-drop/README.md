# AirDrop

AirDrop is a tool for packaging assets in one of two ways:

1. Use the Node.js Connect middleware for compiling, concatenating, minimizing
and delivering your JS and CSS source files to the browser on-the-fly. 
Personally I think this approach is preferable to using build scripts, file watchers, etc.
2. For projects that don't use a Node.js server, the `air-drop` shell command
gives you the same features on the command line as part of your build process.

## Install

Install with `npm`:

```
npm install air-drop
```

If you are using AirDrop on the command line, you will want to install it
globally so that the command is available everywhere:

```
npm install -g air-drop
```

You can run the specs with `npm` as well:

```
cd node_modules/air-drop
npm test
```

## Including JS Files

All the following examples assume you have some kind of a Connect-compatible server:

```javascript
var server = require("connect").createServer();
```

`AirDrop` objects are instantiated with a package url.
To simply include JS files, use the `include` method. Files will
be added to the package in the order you include them.

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .include("public/js/jquery.js")
                .include("public/js/file1.js")
                .include("public/js/file2.js");
server.use(package);
```

## Making It Available

In your client-side code, you can load your JS package with a script tag;
by default, your package will be available at the given URL:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/my-package.js"></script>
```

## Globbing Paths

Rather than including paths one by one, you can use glob wildcards:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .include("public/js/jquery.js")
                .include("public/js/**/*.js")
```

This will first add `jquery.js`, then any other JS files nested inside `public/js`.
NOTE: Because `jquery.js` has already been included, it will not be included a
second time by the glob include.

## Requiring JS Modules

Sharing JS source files between Node and the browser is difficult because the browser
does not natively implement Node's file loading system using `require` and `exports`.
This is easy with AirDrop, though; it will wrap your modules in an AMD `define` blocks for use in the browser.

To explicitly add a file to your package that can be accessed using
`require`, you can use the `require` method:

```javascript
// in lib/my-module.js
exports.helloWorld = function() { return "Hello World!"; };

// in index.html
<script src="/my-package.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var MyModule = require("lib/my-module");
  console.log(MyModule.helloWorld());
</script>

// in your Node script
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js").require("lib/my-module.js")
server.use(package);
```

When any file is included or required by AirDrop, the code is analyzed
for dependencies. AirDrop will automatically read any uses of
`require` in the file and load the dependent code. This also works
for modules located in your `node_modules` directory. For example:

```javascript
// in public/main.js
var _ = require("underscore"),
    a = require("./a.js");
a.sayHello();

// in public/a.js
var b = require("./b.js");
exports.sayHello = function() {
  b.sayHello();
  console.log("Hello from A");
};

// in public/b.js
exports.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello from B");
};

// in server.js
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .include("./public/main.js");
server.use(package);
```

Whenever a file is required with AirDrop (explicitly with `require`
or implicitly as a dependency), AirDrop will automatically include
the `browser-require` library that makes all these require statements work
in the browser. If you have multiple packages being loaded onto a page, you
will only need `browser-require` included in one of them, so you will want
to prevent its inclusion in the others with `useBrowserRequire(false)`:

```javascript
var package1 = AirDrop("/package1.js")
                 .require("lib/mod1");
var package2 = AirDrop("/package2.js")
                 .require("lib/mod2")
                 .useBrowserRequire(false);
```

Using `useBrowserRequire(true)` includes `browser-require` into
the package even if its `require` method was never used.

## Packaging Your Code

By default, `AirDrop` does not package your code, as this makes debugging difficult
in development. Rather, `/air-drop/my-package.js` will dynamically add a script tag
for each of your included scripts so that they will be loaded individually.

When you are ready for your code to be packaged, use the `package` method:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package();
```

The `package` method accepts an optional boolean so that you can package conditionally.
For example, you may only want to package your code if the NODE_ENV environment
variable is set to `production`:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production");
```

## Minimizing Your Code

Minimizing your client code is a good way to reducing file size as well as obfuscating
it from prying eyes. Like the `package` method, the `minimize` method can be called
without an argument, or with a boolean:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production")
                .minimize(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production");
                // or just .minimize()
```

By default, the `minimize` function will use `uglify` to minimize your code. If you
want to customize how your code is minimized, you can pass `minimize` a function instead:

```javascript
function customMinimizer(data, cb) {
  try {
    // do minimization work to data
    cb(null, data);
  } catch(e) {
    cb(e);
  }
}

var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package()
                .minimize(customMinimizer);
```

## Caching Your Packages

Since building these packages can be an expensive operation, you will probably want to cache
the built packages in memory so they are only built once while your process is running.
You can do this using the `cache` method, which takes an optional boolean like `package`
and `minimize`:


```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production")
                .minimize(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production")
                .cache(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production");
                // or just .cache()
```

By default, the `cache` method will use a simple in-memory cache. If you want to use
a different caching method you can pass your own custom cacher to `cache`:

```javascript
function customCacher(key, orig, cb) {
  var cachedData = SomeCache.get(key);
  if(cachedData) {
    cb(null, cachedData);
  } else {
    orig(function(err, data) {
      if(err) { return cb(err); }
      SomeCache.set(key, data);
      cb(null, data);
    });
  }
}

var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js")
                .include("public/js/demo.js")
                .package()
                .cache(customCacher);
```

## Compiling CoffeeScript (and more)

Using CoffeeScript? No problem, any CoffeeScripts will be automatically compiled for you!

If you have some other kind of source that needs to be compiled, you can add your own custom
compiler. For example, if you need to compile "CrazyScript":

```javascript
var CrazyScriptCompiler = function(data, cb) {
  try {
    // do work on data
    cb(null, data);
  }
  catch(e) {
    cb(e);
  }
};

// pathObj is an AirDrop.Path object, and the test returns true/false for whether our
// CrazyScriptCompiler should be used for this path object.
var CrazyScriptTest = function(pathObj) {
  return /crazyscript$/.test(pathObj.path);
};

AirDrop.Compilers.add(CrazyScriptCompiler, CrazyScriptTest);

var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js").require("lib/my-module.crazyscript")
```

You can also explicitly use a custom compiler on a specific include/require:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/my-module.js", {
                  compiler: CrazyScriptCompiler
                });
```

## Stripping Out Server-Only Function Calls

When sharing your code libraries between the server and the client, you may find
places in your code where you have server-only code mixed in with shared code.
While the best solution to this problem is properly modularizing your code and
decoupling, it may be convenient or necessary to strip certain function calls out
of your code before delivering it to your client. This can be accomplished using
the `stripFunction` method:

```javascript
// In your shared code
onServer(function() {
  console.log("Shared code run at", new Date());
});
```

```javascript
// Somewhere in your server-side code
global.onServer = function(func) {
  // On the server, just run the code passed to onServer.
  return func();
};

var package = AirDrop("/my-package.js")
                .require("lib/shared-code.js")
                .stripFunction("onServer")
                .package();
```

This will actually strip all uses of `onServer` out of the source and never
deliver its contents to the client. It goes without saying that this feature
should be used sparingly and with care. If possible, prefer proper code
modularization over source code manipulation.

## Packaging CSS Files

AirDrop supports similar features for packaging CSS files. If the
URL passed to the `AirDrop` function ends in `.css`, the package
will be treated as CSS.

Use `include` to include CSS files into the package, and globs work
too:

```javascript
var package = AirDrop("/my-package.css")
                .include("public/css/vendored/*.css")
                .include("public/css/main.css")
                .package();
```

Similar to JS packages, using the `package` function will concatenate
all the source files into a single file. Without it, the package
file will simply use the CSS `@import` directive to load the
individual files.

## CSS Dependencies

The `@import` CSS directive is convenient but not performant,
so AirDrop will replace all `@import`s with the inline contents of
the imported file. For example:

```css
/* in public/main.css */
@import url("partials/a.css");
@import url("partials/b.css");
.c { color: red; }

/* in public/partials/a.css */
.a { color: blue; }

/* in public/partials/b.css */
.b { color: green; }
```

When packaged, the resulting CSS is:

```css
.a { color: blue; }
.b { color: green; }
.c { color: red; }
```

## Using Stylus and Less

AirDrop ships with compilers for both 
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and 
[Less](http://lesscss.org/) out of the box. All `.styl` and `.less`
files that are included into a package will be compiled automatically. 

*NOTE:* Because Stylus and Less have their own mechanisms for
importing source files using `@import`, AirDrop does not inline the
dependencies like it does with straight CSS files.

## Using the `air-drop` Command

For projects that aren't using Node.js, the `air-drop` command line
tool gives you the same features to build packages, which you can
then make available on your own server.

The `air-drop` command has options that map directly to `AirDrop`
methods, so this command:

```bash
air-drop --include lib/vendor/**/*.js --require lib/shared-code.js --strip-function onServer --minimize > my-package.js
```

is equivalent to the code generated by this JS:

```javascript
AirDrop("/my-package.js")
  .include("lib/vendor/**/*.js")
  .require("lib/shared-code.js")
  .stripFunction("onServer")
  .minimize()
  .package();
```

For CSS packaging, you have to use the `--css` flag to tell AirDrop
that it should handle the files as CSS files. This command:

```bash
air-drop --css --include public/css/vendor/*.css --include public/stylus/main.styl > my-package.css
```

is equivalent to:

```javascript
AirDrop("/my-package.css")
  .include("public/css/vendor/*.css")
  .include("public/stylus/main.styl")
  .package();
```

For syntax help, use `air-drop --help`.

A few notes about the `air-drop` command:

* On the command line, files are always packaged like the `package()`
method is used.
* Caching doesn't make sense on the command line, so there is no
equivalent to the `cache()` method.
* Globs, JS dependencies and CSS dependencies are all supported.
* Paths are added to the package in the order they are included/required.
* Currently the built-in compilers (CoffeeScript, Less, Stylus)
are supported, but custom compilers are not.

## TODO

- Add more robust options parsing and error handling in CLI
- Support modules in `$NODE_PATH`, not just `node_modules`
- Integration level tests
- Improve caching mechanism to integrate storage outside of memory (flat files, memcached)
- Inline documentation
